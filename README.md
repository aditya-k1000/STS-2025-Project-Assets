# STS-2025-Project-Assets

This repository contains assets for my 2025 STS Project titled "A Novel Approach to Detect Periodicity in Cosmic Events: and its Automated Applications to X-Ray Data".

The file "Automatic Periodicity Analysis Functions.py" contains all the functions used in this research.

The folder "Simulation Example" contains an example of what a simulation looks like. It contains several files:
 - "Time-Series Data.pz": contains the binned times array, event list, count rates array, and count rate errors array.
 - "Simulated Data.svg": Graph showing the simulated data.
 - "Step 1.svg": Graph showing results of Step 1 of Period Recovery Algorithm.
 - "Step 2 Iteration 1.svg": Graph showing results of Step 2 Iteration 1 of Period Recovery Algorithm.
 - "Step 2 Iteration 2.svg": Graph showing results of Step 2 Iteration 2 of Period Recovery Algorithm.
 - "Results.csv": CSV file containing results of the Period Recovery Algorithm, including accuracy and computation time.
